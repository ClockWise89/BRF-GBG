Hugo is simple to use, but a bit hard to learn. For the server part all you need to do is type "hugo server" in the terminal when in the site root folder to host a server for the site. The site can be previewed at localhost:1313.

When building the final site make sure the public folder is removed, and then type "hugo". This will build a new public folder with the corresponding files. Upload all the files to the public_html folder on the webbhotell to host the new site.
